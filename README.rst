CEASIOMpy
=========

CEASIOMpy is a conceptual aircraft design environment. CEASIOMpy can be used to set up complex design and optimization workflows, both for conventional and unconventional configurations. Tools for various disciplines in aircraft design are provided, amongst others:

* Aerodynamics
* Weight and balance
* Flight mechanics
* Structures
* Aeroelasticity

    :alt: Example Workflow

CEASIOMpy uses the **CPACS** file format and **RCE** for setting up workflows. Both CPACS and RCE are developed by the German Aerospace Center `DLR <https://www.dlr.de/>`_

**CPACS** *The Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema (CPACS) is a data definition for the air transportation system. CPACS enables engineers to exchange information between their tools.*

**RCE** *RCE is an Open Source distributed, workflow-driven integration environment. It is used by engineers and scientists to design and simulate complex systems (e.g., aircraft, ships, or satellites) by using and integrating their own design and simulation tools.*
