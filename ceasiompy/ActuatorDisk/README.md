# ActuatorDisk

**Categories:** Propulsion, Actuator disk theory

**State**: :heavy_check_mark:

`ActuatorDisk` is a module developed starting from OptimalProp.py a script crated by University of Naples, thanks to which is possible to obtain a ready-to-use output file to perform a CFD calculation with SU2Run module.

The output file.dat contains the distribution along the propeller's blade of thrust and power coefficients that are useful for SU2 to perforform an inviscid calculation to obtain variation of pressure and velocity near the actuator disk.

## Inputs

`ActuatorDisk` takes as input a CPACS file. This is done automatically when it is run in workflow

Multiple options are available with `ActuatorDisk`, you can see these options if you run this module from the GUI interface.

General options:

Geometrical propeller settings: 

* `Cruise mach`
Flight cruise mach velocity of the aricraft

* `Cruise altitude`
Flight cruise altitude of the aricraft

* `Blade discretization`
Number of elements to discretize the propeller's blades

* `Radius`
Radius of propeller's blade

* `Hub radius`
Hub radius of propeller's blade

* `Blades number`
Number of blades that the propeller has

Operative propeller settings:

* `Thrust`
Thrust generated by the propeller 

* `Rotational velocity`
Rotational velocity of the propeller 

Correction settings:

* `Tip without loss correction`
That implies that the correction function to correct thrust at the blade's tip will not be used 

* `Tip loss correction`
If it is activate the thrust at the tip will be corrected using a function implemented in the program

## Analyses

ActuatorDisk computes thrust distribution along propeller radius of a turboprop engine with the purpose of analyze the behavior of the propeller in different flight condition, so for a given thrust.

## Outputs

`ActuatorDisk` outputs a file.dat called "ActuatorDisk.dat", that will be read by SU2Run, another CEASIOMpy module, which perform a CFD calculaton

## Installation or requirements

`ActuatorDisk` is a native CEASIOMpy module, hence it is available and installed by default. To run it, you just have to be sure that you are in the CEASIOMpy Conda environment.

## Limitations

Actuator disk theory is a basic, but very powerful theory, thanks to which is possible to have an idea of variation of pressure and velocity through the actuator disk. The performed caluclation is invicid, so the friction is not included, also the blades' tangential velocity is not take into account.

It could be possible apply this theory to a rotorcraft engine, but not in CEASIOMpy programm.
