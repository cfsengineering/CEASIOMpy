**Categories:** Geometry, CPACS, Aircraft modeling, CAO

**State**: :heavy_check_mark:

`CPACSCreator` module is just a launcher for [CPACSCreator](https://dlr-sc.github.io/tigl/doc/cpacscreator-0.1/) which has been developed in collaboration between CFS Engineering and DLR [[1]](#Drou18). CPACSCreator is a CAD tool for creating and modifying a CPACS file.

CPACSCreator can be used to create or modify existing CPACS file of aircraft.

## Inputs

In a CEASIOMpy workflow `CPACSCreator` takes as input a CPACS file, the other inputs are the modifications made by the user on the aircraft geometry.

## Analyses

`CPACSCreator` computes nothing, however it allows you to modify an aircraft geometry and add or remove some of theses parts.

## Outputs

`CPACSCreator` outputs a CPACS files with the modified aircraft geometry.

:warning: Do not forget to save the aircraft before you close CPACSCreator.

## Installation or requirements

`CPACSCreator` is installed automatically when install the CEASIOMpy Conda environement. To run it, you just have to be sure you are in the CEASIOMpy Conda environment.

## Limitations

`CPACSCreator` allows you to modify the wings and fuselage of an aircraft. For now it is not possible to add or modify things like engines, control surfaces, landing gear, etc.
