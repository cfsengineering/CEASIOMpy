----------------- Physical Case Definition ( Zone 0 ) -------------------
Compressible Euler equations.
Mach number: 0.3.
Angle of attack (AoA): 0 deg, and angle of sideslip (AoS): 0 deg.
No restart solution, use the values at infinity (freestream).
Non-Dimensional simulation (V=1.0, Rho=1.0, T=1.0 at the farfield).
The reference area is 122.4 m^2.
The semi-span will be computed using the max y(3D) value.
The reference length is 4.193 m.
Surface(s) where the force coefficients are evaluated and 
their reference origin for moment computation: 
   - Fuselage1 (0, 0, 0).
   - Wing3V (0, 0, 0).
   - Wing2H (0, 0, 0).
   - Wing1 (0, 0, 0) m.
Surface(s) where the objective function is evaluated: WING.
Surface(s) plotted in the output file: Fuselage1, Wing3V, Wing2H, Wing1.
Surface(s) affected by the design variables: Fuselage1, Wing3V, Wing2H, Wing1.
