What Can TetGen Do?

  TetGen generates Delaunay tetrahedralizations, constrained
  Delaunay tetrahedralizations, and quality tetrahedral meshes.

Command Line Syntax:
                                                                                                                     
  Below is the basic command line syntax of TetGen with a list of short                                              
  descriptions. Underscores indicate that numbers may optionally                                                     
  follow certain switches.  Do not leave any space between a switch                                                  
  and its numeric parameter.  'input_file' contains input data                                                       
  depending on the switches you supplied which may be a   piecewise                                                  
  linear complex or a list of nodes.  File formats and detailed                                                      
  description of command line switches are found in user's manual.

    -h  Help:  A brief instruction for using TetGen.

Examples of How to Use TetGen:

  'tetgen object' reads vertices from object.node, and writes their
  Delaunay tetrahedralization to object.1.node, object.1.ele
  (tetrahedra), and object.1.face (convex hull faces).

  'tetgen -p object' reads a PLC from object.poly or object.smesh (and
  possibly object.node) and writes its constrained Delaunay
  tetrahedralization to object.1.node, object.1.ele, object.1.face,
  (boundary faces) and object.1.edge (boundary edges).

  'tetgen -pq1.414a.1 object' reads a PLC from object.poly or
  object.smesh (and possibly object.node), generates a mesh whose
  tetrahedra have radius-edge ratio smaller than 1.414 and have volume
  of 0.1 or less, and writes the mesh to object.1.node, object.1.ele,
  object.1.face, and object.1.edge
