Writing a new module
--------------------

* First, you should check the code guidelines

* Fork the CEASIOMpy repository on you own Github account

* On your own fork you can now:

* Copy the module named " ModuleTemplate"

* Rename it as you want

* Write all the functions it needs to run

* Write its ``__specs__.py`` file, which describes its input/output and RCE integration

* Write its test functions , for example you can check: test/TestModuleTemplate/
