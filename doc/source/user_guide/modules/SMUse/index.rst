SMUse
=====

:Categories: Optimisation module

This module is used to make prediction with surrogate models.


Installation
------------

The SMUse module is a native |name| module, hence it is available and installed by default.

Analyses
--------

The SMUse module will predict an output for a given set of inputs. The input/output ensemble may be different for each model, as it will be the same ensemble it used to be trained.

Output
------

SMUse module outputs no other file than the usual CPACS from the ToolOutput.

Required CPACS input and settings
---------------------------------

The input CPACS file must contain the location of a binary file in which a surrogate model is saved.

Limitations
-----------

* No limitation is currently known to this module.
