:Categories: Mission analysis, Stability

This module is made to check the static stability of an aircraft along longitudinal, lateral and directional axis.


Installation
------------

StabilityStatic is a native |name| module, hence it is available and installed by default.

Analyses
--------

StabilityStatic check static stabilities in the tree main directions: longitudinal, lateral and directional. For each one, it writes in the CPACS file is stable of not (or not calculated). If stable, it also returns the value of the trim conditions.

Output
------

A lot of graph are produce and saved in /ToolOutput.

Required CPACS input and settings
---------------------------------

The CPACS must contains an aeroMap. The aeroMap must contained at least a few points to calculate stability (several angle of attack for longitudinal and several angle of sideslip for lateral and directional).

Limitations
-----------

Calculation of the trim conditions with deflected control surface is not automated yet.
