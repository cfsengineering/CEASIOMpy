#Disclaimer, it maybe necessary to compile some libraries, like eigen or install them using dnf install
#might be useful tu specify gcc version compiler, in case do <source /opt/rh/gcc-toolset-10/enable> before make
qmake pentagrow.pro

make

sudo dnf install hdf5_static
--> apparement plutot sudo dnf install hdf5-devel

cd ~/surf

make

in pentagrow.pro check if -lz is written in the row where -lsurf is

 




(should add "make clean before, maybe)

to run good version :
/home/cfse4/Pentagrow/bin/pentagrow config.cfg cube_simple_mesh.stl



In fact, when already compiled:
only need to delete the .o of the modified folder, and do the command "make" in the folder it was deleted in.

If work in a subfolder, need to do that to the file in subfolder, then come make in the principal file (need to take out frontend.o? not sure)
