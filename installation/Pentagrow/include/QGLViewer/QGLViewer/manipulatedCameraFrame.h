  /*! \brief The ManipulatedCameraFrame class represents a ManipulatedFrame with Camera specific mouse bindings.
  \class ManipulatedCameraFrame manipulatedCameraFrame.h QGLViewer/manipulatedCameraFrame.h

  A ManipulatedCameraFrame is a specialization of a ManipulatedFrame, designed to be set as the
  Camera::frame(). Mouse motions are basically interpreted in a negated way: when the mouse goes to
  the right, the ManipulatedFrame translation goes to the right, while the ManipulatedCameraFrame
  has to go to the \e left, so that the \e scene seems to move to the right.

  A ManipulatedCameraFrame rotates around its revolveAroundPoint(), which corresponds to the
  associated Camera::revolveAroundPoint().

  A ManipulatedCameraFrame can also "fly" in the scene. It basically moves forward, and turns
  according to the mouse motion. See flySpeed(), flyUpVector() and the QGLViewer::MOVE_FORWARD and
  QGLViewer::MOVE_BACKWARD QGLViewer::MouseAction.

  See the <a href="../mouse.html">mouse page</a> for a description of the possible actions that can
  be performed using the mouse and their bindings.
