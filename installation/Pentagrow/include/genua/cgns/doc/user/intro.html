<p>
This User's Guide (originally published as NASA/TM-2001-211236, October
2001) has been written to aid users in the implementation
of CGNS (CFD General Notation System).
It is intended as a tutorial: light in content, but
heavy in examples, advice, and guidelines.  Readers interested in
additional details are referred to other documents, listed in the references,
which are available from the
<a href="http://cgns.sourceforge.net/index.html">CGNS website</a>
<img src="../external.png" alt="external link">.

<a name="sec:whatCGNS"></a>
<h3>What is CGNS?</h3>

<p>
CGNS (CFD General Notation System) originated in 1994
as a joint effort between Boeing and NASA, and has since grown
to include many other contributing organizations worldwide.
It is an effort to <em>standardize</em>
CFD input and output, including grid (both structured
and unstructured), flow solution,
connectivity, BCs, and auxiliary information.
CGNS is also easily extensible, and allows
for file-stamping and user-inserted-commenting.
It employs <a href="../adf/index.html">ADF (Advanced Data Format)</a>,
a system which creates binary files that are portable across computer
platforms.
CGNS also includes a second layer of software known as the
<a href="../midlevel/index.html">mid-level library</a>, or API
(Application Programming Interface), which eases the implementation of
CGNS into existing CFD codes.
[With the release of CGNS Version 2.4, the mid-level library may be
built using either ADF or <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/">HDF</a>
<img src="../external.png" alt="external link"> (Hierarchical Data
Format) as the underlying data format.
The remainder of this <i>User's Guide</i> only refers to ADF, but at the
mid-level library level the differences should be transparent to most
users.]

<p>
In 1999, control of CGNS was completely transferred to a public
forum known as the CGNS Steering Committee.  This Steering 
Committee is made up of international representatives from 
government and private industry.  All CGNS software
is completely free and open to anyone (open source).  The
CGNS standard is also the object of an ISO standardization 
effort for fluid dynamics data, for 
release some time in the early to mid-2000's.

<h3>Why CGNS?</h3>

<p>
CGNS will eventually eliminate most of the translator
programs now necessary when working between machines
and between CFD codes.  Also, it eventually may allow for the
results from one code to be easily restarted using another
code.  It will hopefully therefore save a lot of time and
money.  In particular, it is hoped that future grid-generation
software will generate grids <em>with all connectivity and BC
information included</em> as part of a CGNS database, saving 
time and avoiding potential costly errors in setting
up this information after-the-fact.

<a name="sec:whatCGNSfile"></a>
<h3>What is a CGNS File?</h3>

<p>
A CGNS file is an entity that is
organized (inside the file itself) into a set of "nodes" in a tree-like
structure, in much the same way as directories are
organized in the UNIX environment.
[Strictly speaking, because links may be used to store information in
multiple files, there is no notion of a CGNS <i>file</i>, only of a CGNS
<i>database</i> implemented within one or more files.
However, throughout this document the two phrases are used
interchangeably.]
The top-most node is referred to
as the "root node."  Each node below the root node
is defined by both a name and a label, and
may or may not contain information or data.  
Each node can also be a "parent" to one or more
"child" nodes.  A node can also have as a child node a link
to a node elsewhere in the file or to a node in a separate
CGNS file altogether.  Links are transparent to the user:
the user "sees" linked children nodes as
if they truly exist in the current tree.
An example of a CGNS tree-like structure is shown below.

     alt="Figure showing file structure with root node, child nodes, and a link">
<br><br>
Example CGNS tree-like structure.
</center>

<p>
In order for any user to be able to interpret a CGNS file, its
nodes must be assembled according to particular rules.
For example, the figure below shows a simple example
of a tree-like structure that organizes some animals into
categories according to rules that most of us are very
familiar with.  (Note that this figure is different from 
the previous figure in that no "Labels" or "Data" are
used, only "Names.")

<a name="FIGintro_2"></a>
<p>

<img src="figures/intro_2.gif"
     alt="Figure showing file structure for categorizing animals"
     longdesc="figures/intro_2.html">
<br><br>

</center>

<br>
The categories get narrower and narrower in their scope
as you traverse lower in the tree.  The broadest category here
is "Animals," and the tree narrows all the way down to
particular dogs (two "Fido"s, a "Spot," and a "Ginger").
Knowing ahead of time how this tree is organized allows you
to quickly and easily access whatever particular information
from the tree that you may be interested in.
If someone else were to organize these same animals in a completely
different way, according to different rules, then it would be
difficult for you to access the desired information without
spending a lot of time searching and studying the tree.

<p>
The particular rules for organizing CGNS files for aerodynamic
data, which allow users to easily access desired information, are described
in the <a href="../sids/index.html">Standard Interface Data Structures (SIDS) 
document</a>.
Because CGNS files are binary files, they cannot be viewed by
the user with standard UNIX ASCII-editing tools.
The utility <a href="../cgnstools/index.html#ADFviewer">adfviewer</a>
was created to allow users to easily view CGNS files.

<h3>How this User's Guide is Organized</h3>

<p>
The main content in this User's Guide is located in the
<a href="started.html">Getting Started</a> section, where several
simple examples are
given for both structured and unstructured grids.  This section
covers the basics that most users want or need to learn in order
to get started using CGNS.
It is recommended that the <a href="started.html#sec:str">section on
structured grids</a> be read first, in its entirety, even if the user is
only interested in unstructured grid applications.
Some <a href="additional.html">additional information</a> is covered
in the following section; these issues are felt to be important
(i.e., most users will want to eventually include them), but
they are not as crucial as the basic items covered under
<a href="started.html">Getting Started</a>.
Sections are also included on 
<a href="trouble.html">troubleshooting</a> and
<a href="faq.html">frequently asked questions</a>.

<p>
Note that all of the codes and code segments given in this document are
available as complete codes from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns">CGNS site at SourceForge</a>
<img src="../external.png" alt="external link">.
The <a href="examples.html">names of these codes and their functions</a>
are also listed in this document.  Also note that not all CGNS capabilities
are covered in this document.  It is meant to be a fairly simple
introductory guide only.
