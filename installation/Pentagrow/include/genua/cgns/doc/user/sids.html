<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

<p>
As mentioned in the <a href="intro.html">Introduction</a>, a 
CGNS file is organized into a set of "nodes" in a tree-like
structure, in much the same way as directories are
organized in the UNIX environment.
Each node is identified by both a label and a name.
Most node <em>labels</em> are given by a series of characters 
followed by "_t".  There are generally very strict rules
governing the labeling conventions in a CGNS file.  Node <em>names</em> 
are sometimes user-defined, but sometimes must also follow 
strict naming conventions.  The label identifies
a "<em>type</em>."  For example, <tt>Zone_t</tt> identifies a Zone-type
node, and <tt>DataArray_t</tt> identifies a type of node that contains
a data array.  The name identifies a specific instance of
the particular node type.  For example, <tt>Density</tt> is the name of
a node of type <tt>DataArray_t</tt> that contains an array of densities.

<p>
As you become more familiar with how CGNS files are
organized, you will notice that,
generally, the higher you are in the CGNS hierarchy, the more
important the label is (names tend to be user-defined); whereas
the lower you are in the hierarchy, the more important the
name is.  This convention arises because at the higher levels,
the broader categories are established, and are used to determine
"where to go" in the hierarchy.   At the lower levels, the category becomes
less important because this is the region where you are
searching for specific items.

<p>
Throughout the remainder of this
first section, we will primarily be referring to the nodes by their
<em>label</em>, because we are focusing on the "big picture."
In later sections, as we get into specific examples,
both names and labels will be referred to.

<p>
It is important to note at this point that the SIDS document
specifies the layout of the CGNS file, in terms of parents
and children.  However, when a given piece of information is
listed as being "under" a node, there are actually two possibilities:
the information can be stored <i>as data <u>in</u> the current node</i>,
or it can be stored <i>as data <u>in or under</u> a separate child node</i>.
This distinction is illustrated in the figure below.
The <a href="../filemap/index.html">SIDS-to-ADF File Mapping Manual</a>
determines which of the two
possibilities are used for each situation, and must always be
consulted along with the <a href="../sids/index.html">SIDS document</a>.
(Note there is also a <a href="../filemap_hdf/index.html">SIDS-to-HDF
File Mapping Manual</a> available.)
Throughout the remainder
of this section, the location of information (whether
as data or as a separate child node) will always be explicitly
specified, according to the SIDS-to-ADF mapping document.

<p>
The remainder of this section attempts to summarize the most
important and most commonly-used aspects of the SIDS.  It does not
cover all possible nodes or situations.  It is intended as a 
general overview only.  It is also likely
that future extensions to the SIDS will add additional capabilities
beyond what we cover here.

<p>
The top, or entry-level, of the CGNS file is always what is 
referred to as the "root node."  Children to be found
directly under this node are the node <tt>CGNSLibraryVersion_t</tt> and
one or more <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> nodes.  The <tt>CGNSLibraryVersion_t</tt> node
has, as its data, the version (release) number
of the CGNS standard as defined by the SIDS.
The <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> node represents the top level for a given
database, or "case."
Most CGNS files will only have one <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> node, although
the SIDS allows for any number in order to remain extensible
and to allow for the possibility of having more than one
"case" in a single file.  Here, the definition of "case"
is left open.  For the remainder of this section, we assume that
there is only one <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> node within a given CGNS file.

<p>
The <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> node may have, as its children, the following
nodes:  <tt>Zone_t</tt>, <tt>ConvergenceHistory_t</tt>,
<tt>BaseIterativeData_t</tt>,  <tt>SimulationType_t</tt>,
<tt>Family_t</tt>, <tt>IntegralData_t</tt>,
<tt>DataClass_t</tt>, <tt>FlowEquationSet_t</tt>, 
<tt>DimensionalUnits_t</tt>, <tt>ReferenceState_t</tt>,
<tt>Axisymmetry_t</tt>, <tt>RotatingCoordinates_t</tt>,
<tt>Gravity_t</tt>, <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt>,and
<tt>Descriptor_t</tt>.

<p>
The <tt>Zone_t</tt> node gives information about a particular zone of
the grid; most of the data in the CGNS file is usually found 
under this node.  Any 
number of <tt>Zone_t</tt> nodes is allowed at this level.  Its children will 
be described in greater detail below.  <tt>ConvergenceHistory_t</tt>
contains solution history information typically output by many
CFD codes, such as residual, lift, drag, etc. as a function of
iteration number.  By convention, its name is
<tt>GlobalConvergenceHistory</tt>.
A <tt>ConvergenceHistory_t</tt> node can exist under the
<tt>Zone_t</tt> node as well, but there, its name is by convention
<tt>ZoneConvergenceHistory</tt>.
<tt>BaseIterativeData_t</tt> stores information relating to the times
and/or iteration numbers for a database in which flow solutions and/or
grids at multiple times are stored.
<tt>SimulationType_t</tt> describes the type of simulation stored (i.e.,
<tt>TimeAccurate</tt> or <tt>NonTimeAccurate</tt>).
<tt>Family_t</tt> is generally used to tie the grid to geometric CAD
data, or to link certain entities together as a common part (e.g.,
"wing," "strut," etc.).
Any number of <tt>Family_t</tt> nodes is allowed.
<tt>Axisymmetry_t</tt>, <tt>RotatingCoordinates_t</tt>, and
<tt>Gravity_t</tt> are used for specific situations; details can be
found in the SIDS.

<p>
The remaining nodes allowed under <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> are somewhat
more generic, and can exist at other levels in the hierarchy
beside this one.  They are briefly described here.
<tt>IntegralData_t</tt> is a "catch-all" node for storing any 
desired sets of generic data.  Any number of <tt>IntegralData_t</tt>
nodes is allowed at this level. 
<tt>DataClass_t</tt> (which, by convention, has the name <tt>DataClass</tt>)
indicates the form that the data in the <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> is
stored, for example:  <tt>Dimensional</tt>, <tt>NormalizedByDimensional</tt>,
or <tt>NormalizedByUnknownDimensional</tt>.
<tt>FlowEquationSet_t</tt> 
(which, by convention, has the name <tt>FlowEquationSet</tt>)
defines the equations used in the CFD
simulation.  <tt>DimensionalUnits_t</tt> (which, by convention, has the name 
<tt>DimensionalUnits</tt>)
defines the dimensional units used (if any).  <tt>ReferenceState_t</tt>
(which, by convention, has the name <tt>ReferenceState</tt>)
defines a reference state.  This node is where quantities such
as Reynolds number, Mach number, and other reference quantities
that define the flow field conditions and/or the 
nondimensionalizations are stored.
<tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt> is used to store user-defined data that is
(by definition) not part of the SIDS standard.
Finally, <tt>Descriptor_t</tt> is used to store descriptor strings. 
Any number of <tt>Descriptor_t</tt> nodes is allowed at this level.

<a name="dimensions"></a>
<p>
The data stored within the <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> node itself are the 
<tt>CellDimension</tt> and the <tt>PhysicalDimension</tt>.
The <tt>CellDimension</tt> is the dimensionality of the cells in the
mesh (e.g., 3 for volume cell, 2 for face cell).
The <tt>PhysicalDimension</tt> is the number of coordinates required to
define a node position (e.g., 1 for 1-D, 2 for 2-D, 3 for 3-D).
The index dimension, which is the number of different indices
required to reference a node (e.g., 1=<i>i</i>, 2=<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>,
3=<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>,<i>k</i>), is not stored, but can be
determined for each zone based on its type (<tt>Structured</tt> or
<tt>Unstructured</tt>).
If
<tt>Structured</tt>, the index dimension is the same as <tt>CellDimension</tt>.
If <tt>Unstructured</tt>, the index dimension is 1.

<p>
Much information can be stored under <tt>Zone_t</tt>.  Because this is
an overview, we do not go through it all here.  Instead, we only
highlight the features that most users are likely to use. 
<tt>ZoneType_t</tt> (which, by convention, has the name <tt>ZoneType</tt>)
stores the name <tt>Structured</tt> or <tt>Unstructured</tt>.
<tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt> is the parent node of the grid coordinates 
arrays, such as <tt>CoordinateX</tt>, <tt>CoordinateY</tt>, 
and <tt>CoordinateZ</tt>.  
Any number of <tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt> nodes are
allowed at this level (to handle the case of deforming
grids).  By convention, the original grid coordinates
has the name <tt>GridCoordinates</tt>.
<tt>FlowSolution_t</tt> stores under it nodes which contain the flow
solution; for example, <tt>Density</tt>, <tt>VelocityX</tt>, 
<tt>VelocityY</tt>,
<tt>VelocityZ</tt>, and <tt>Pressure</tt>.
It also gives the location at which the solution is stored (e.g.,
<tt>CellCenter</tt>, <tt>Vertex</tt>), and includes the possibility for
including <tt>Rind</tt> (ghost cell or ghost point) information.
Any number of <tt>FlowSolution_t</tt> nodes are
allowed at this level.  The <tt>Elements_t</tt> data structure holds
unstructured element data such as connectivity, neighbors,
etc.  Any number of 
<tt>Elements_t</tt> nodes are allowed at this level.
<tt>ZoneIterativeData_t</tt> stores information necessary
for a database in which flow solutions at multiple times are stored.
Other important nodes under <tt>Zone_t</tt> are <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt>
(which, by convention, has the name <tt>ZoneBC</tt>)
and <tt>ZoneGridConnectivity_t</tt> (which, by convention, has the name 
<tt>ZoneGridConnectivity</tt>).  These store the boundary conditions and
the grid connectivity information, respectively.
More will be said about these nodes later.

<p>
The data stored within the <tt>Zone_t</tt> node itself are
the <tt>VertexSize</tt>, the <tt>CellSize</tt>, and the
<tt>VertexSizeBoundary</tt>.
These are dimensioned by the index dimension, and give the number of
vertices, the number of cells, and the number of boundary vertices (used
for sorted elements in unstructured zones only), respectively.

<a name="Zonenaming"></a>
<p>
An important point to note here is that the API sorts the <tt>Zone_t</tt>
nodes alphanumerically according to their <em>name</em> when
it reads them.  This
was deemed necessary because most CFD codes currently perform
operations on the zones of multiple-zone grids in a certain order.
To duplicate existing non-CGNS applications, it is 
necessary to insure that zones can be read in the desired
sequence.  (ADF does not necessarily retrieve data in the same 
order in which it was stored, so the API reader for zones was
built to do this.)  Hence, when <em>naming</em> zones, the user should
make sure they are named alphanumerically (if an ordering is
desired).

<p>
For example, the naming convention <tt>ZoneN</tt>, where N is the zone
number, is alphanumeric only up to <tt>Zone9</tt>.
<tt>Zone10</tt> through <tt>Zone19</tt> would get sorted between
<tt>Zone1</tt> and <tt>Zone2</tt>, and so on.
Spaces are allowed in names, so <tt>Zone&nbsp;&nbsp;N</tt>,
with two spaces, (e.g., <tt>Zone&nbsp;&nbsp;1</tt>,
<tt>Zone&nbsp;&nbsp;2</tt>,... <tt>Zone&nbsp;99</tt>,
<tt>Zone100</tt>,...) is alphanumeric up to <tt>Zone999</tt>.
Other zone naming conventions are certainly possible, and are completely
up to the user to define appropriately.

<p>
A summary graphic of the overall layout of a typical CGNS file 
is given below.  
This figure shows the hierarchical data structure,
and the relative locations of the nodes.  It also indicates
(informally) what data, if any, is stored <em>within</em> each node.

Note that all possible nodes are <em>not</em>
included here.  In particular, note that <tt>Elements_t</tt> nodes are
not shown under <tt>Zone_t</tt>; 
<i>the</i> <tt>Elements_t</tt> <i>nodes would be present
for an unstructured zone</i>.  
Also note that nodes that occur
under <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt> and <tt>ZoneGridConnectivity_t</tt> have been omitted;
these will also be covered below.
Optional nodes such as 
<tt>SimulationType_t</tt> (under <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt>) are not included.
And finally, note that multiple <tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt> and
<tt>FlowSolution_t</tt> nodes are allowed, but we show in the figure
only one of each.
Multiple <tt>FlowSolution_t</tt> nodes are usually only used in
the situation when multiple times of time-accurate data are
stored, and multiple <tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt> nodes are used
for deforming grids.

<a name="sec:lowerlevels"></a>
<h3>Implementation at the Lower Levels of the Hierarchy</h3>

<p>
Most of the actual data is at the lower levels of the CGNS
hierarchy.  We do not go into great detail here; the examples 
in the main body of this document serve as instruction for this.
However, there are several general items of importance 
related to the storage of data that are appropriate to mention
here.

<p>
Many specific items, variables, and conditions that relate to CFD
data are specified in the SIDS.
These are <a href="../sids/dataname.html">standardized <em>names</em></a>
that must be used in order that other users will understand
what is in your CGNS file.
For example, the static density must
be called <tt>Density</tt>.  Any other name may not be recognized by other
users.  In fact, if another application code expects "<tt>Density</tt>," but
you name it "<tt>density</tt>" (lower case "<tt>d</tt>"), then chances are the
other code's search will fail.

<p>
Naturally, the items listed in the SIDS
cannot cover all possible items required by users.
Hence, the SIDS allows for the use of the 
type <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt> for any special type not covered.
For example, there are currently only a limited number of
defined names for turbulence models in the SIDS (e.g.,
<tt>OneEquation_SpalartAllmaras</tt>).  As everyone knows, there
are a <em>huge</em> number of turbulence models and turbulence model
variants that exist, so that the SIDS cannot hope to
define standardized names for all of them.  The type <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt>
covers this situation.

<p>
When <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt> is used, however, the user runs the risk
that others will be unable to interpret the CGNS file.
We therefore recommend that whenever a <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt> type is
unavoidable, the user also include a companion <tt>Descriptor_t</tt>
node to specify what was done.

<p>
It is possible that, if certain items are found to be used more heavily
as time goes on, that standardized names may be created and added to the
SIDS in the future.

<a name="sec:bcs"></a>
<h3>Boundary Conditions</h3>

<p>
The boundary conditions hierarchical structure in CGNS can appear
to be somewhat daunting at first.  Because the CGNS team decided
to make the boundary condition information as descriptive as possible
and easily extensible to complex situations, there are many
layers possible in the hierarchy, and the usage rules can
become complex.

<p>
However, the SIDS allows for use of simplified versions of the
<tt>ZoneBC_t</tt> node, which are easier to understand and adopt.
Essentially, the simplified versions "cut off" the hierarchy
at a higher level than the full-blown 
SIDS boundary condition description.  The
implication of this is that application codes that use
a simplified version must interpret what is meant by each 
particular boundary condition type, without the help of the CGNS file.

<p>
For example, the boundary condition 
type <tt>BCFarfield</tt> indicates a boundary condition
applied to a far field boundary.  Most CFD codes have this type,
which performs different functions depending upon whether the
local flow field is inflow or outflow, subsonic or supersonic.
The full-blown SIDS description of <tt>BCFarfield</tt> attempts to
describe in some detail the methodology involved in this boundary
condition.  However, if the user chooses to use the minimal "cut off"
version, the only information regarding the function of the
boundary condition that is stored in the CGNS file is the
<em>name</em> <tt>BCFarfield</tt>.
An application code must determine from this name alone what is meant.

<a name="FIGbc"></a>
<p>
<center>
<img src="figures/bc.gif"
     alt="Diagram showing lowest allowed and fully SIDS-compliant boundary condition implementation levels"
     longdesc="figures/bc.html">
<br><br>
General hierarchical structure of <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt>.
</center>

<p>
Example hierarchical structures for both the simplest 
implementation as well as the full-blown implementation
of the <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt> node are shown in the above figure.  (These
hierarchies make use of an <tt>IndexRange_t</tt> node.  It is
also possible to use an <tt>IndexArray_t</tt>, which gives a complete
list of boundary indices or elements, rather than a
range.)  Note that an intermediate structure, where <tt>BCDataSet_t</tt> and
<tt>BCTypeSimple_t</tt> are both given but <tt>DirichletData</tt> and
<tt>NeumannData</tt> are not, is also allowed.

<p>
Many boundary condition types are currently defined in the SIDS,
but they by no means cover all possible boundary conditions.
The type <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt> can be used for any special type not
covered that the user finds impossible to describe using the existing
SIDS.  When <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt> is used,
a companion descriptor node is helpful to describe what was done.

<a name="sec:connectivity"></a>
<h3>Zone Connectivity</h3>

<p>
It is often desirable to specify zone connectivity information when
parts of a zone connect with parts of another zone or itself.  The
connectivity information tells how zones fit together or how a
zone twists to reconnect with itself; the information
is needed by most CFD flow solvers.

<p>
There are three types of connectivity that can occur:  point-by-point,
patched, and overset.  The point-by-point, or 1-to-1, type occurs
when the edges of zones abut, and grid vertices from one patch
exactly correspond with grid vertices from the other, with no
points missing a partner.  The patched type occurs when
the edges of zones abut, but there is not a correspondence of the
points, or they are not partnered with another point.  The 
overset type occurs when zones overlap one another (or a zone overlaps
itself).

<p>
The SIDS allows for the specification of each of these types of zone 
connectivity under the <tt>ZoneGridConnectivity_t</tt> node.  All three
types can be implemented through the general <tt>GridConnectivity_t</tt> 
subnode (overset also requires the use of <tt>OversetHoles_t</tt> nodes).
However, the 1-to-1 type can also utilize, in certain
circumstances, the more specific <tt>GridConnectivity1to1_t</tt> subnode.

<p>
The following figure shows a sample hierarchy starting at the
<tt>ZoneGridConnectivity_t</tt> node, for a 1-to-1 type of interface
using a <tt>GridConnectivity1to1_t</tt> subnode.  Note in this figure that
we now list the name, label, and data within each node.  For this
structure, the naming convention at the bottom level
is particularly important, and
is actually more descriptive than the labels.  In fact, the label
for the <tt>Transform</tt> node is very strange, and does not even follow 
the usual "_t" convention.
As can be seen in the figure, multiple nodes are allowed under
the <tt>ZoneGridConnectivity_t</tt> node.  These can be any combination of
<tt>GridConnectivity1to1_t</tt>, <tt>GridConnectivity_t</tt>, 
<tt>OversetHoles_t</tt>, or <tt>Descriptor_t</tt> nodes.

<p>
A sample hierarchy (again starting at the <tt>ZoneGridConnectivity_t</tt>
node) is shown in the next figure
for an <em>overset</em> interface using a <tt>GridConnectivity_t</tt> 
subnode.  The case for a <em>patched</em> interface would look the
same, except there would be no <tt>OversetHoles_t</tt> node
or its children and <tt>GridConnectivityType</tt> would be <tt>Abutting</tt>.
Note that <tt>CellListDonor</tt> 
and <tt>InterpolantsDonor</tt> are used for
patched or overset interfaces.

1-to-1.)

<h3>Structured Zone Example</h3>

<p>
The following is an example for a structured grid.
It corresponds with the <a href="../sids/cnct.html#ex:1to1a">"1-to-1
Abutting of Complete Faces" example</a> in the SIDS document.
It is a 3-D two-zone case, where the two zones are connected in
a 1-to-1 fashion at one of each of their faces.  Zone 1 is
9 &times; 17 &times; 11 and zone 2 is 9 &times; 17 &times; 21.
The <i>k</i>-max face of zone 1 abuts the <i>k</i>-min face of zone 2.

<p>
The hierarchy is shown in the following four figures.  
Only directly relevant parts of the
hierarchy are shown here for clarity.  For example, <tt>DataClass_t</tt>,
<tt>ReferenceState_t</tt>, <tt>ConvergenceHistory_t</tt>, 
<tt>FlowEquationSet_t</tt>, and <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt> 
have all been left off.  However, these (and other) items are
<em>not</em> required, and the figure still represents a valid
SIDS-compliant CGNS file.  Note that a data type of MT
indicates that there is no data stored in the node.

In other words, the zone 1 solution points <em>do not</em>
correspond with the grid points (as they do in zone 2).  
They are defined <em>within</em> the volumes surrounded by the
grid points.
This example is constructed this way for the
purpose of illustration, but it is unusual; typically one would use 
only a single flow solution data location
for the entire file.

<p>
This example also illustrates the use of the <tt>Rind_t</tt> node, and how
it affects the data arrays under a <tt>FlowSolution_t</tt>.  A rind
node under <tt>FlowSolution_t</tt> is used
to indicate that the flow solution is outputting
additional rind or "ghost" data outside one or more boundaries
of the zone.
(A rind node can also be used under <tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt>
and <tt>DiscreteData_t</tt>.)
See the SIDS document for a <a href="../sids/build.html#Rind">more
complete description</a>.  In zone 1 in this example, 
there are no additional ghost cell
data in the <i>i</i>-direction, there is one ghost cell next to
each of <i>j</i>-min and <i>j</i>-max, and there are 3 ghost cells next
to <i>k</i>-min and 2 next to <i>k</i>-max.  (Admittedly, this example is
very contrived - most applications would be more consistent
in their use of rind cells.)
Because of the rind cells, the <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, and <i>k</i> ranges of
all flow solution data arrays in zone 1 are extended appropriately.

<p>
It is very important for the user to realize that including rind 
cells affects how the data is stored in the <tt>DataArray_t</tt>'s.
In other words, when reading a CGNS file one cannot ignore
<tt>Rind_t</tt> nodes if they are present, and attempting to read
the <tt>DataArray_t</tt>'s using unmodified <tt>VertexSize</tt> or 
<tt>CellSize</tt> dimensions
will result in the retrieval of nonsensical data.

<p>
Note that the SIDS specifies many defaults.  For example, the
default <tt>Transform</tt> values are (1,2,3), and the default
<tt>GridLocation</tt> is <tt>Vertex</tt>.  
Hence, the nodes that contain these particular
values in the example are not strictly necessary.
The API sometimes leaves out default information.

<p>
Another important fact is illustrated in this example.  When the names
of a type of node (of given label) are user defined, 
the names must be <em>different</em> if they
have the same parent node.
For example, the two <tt>Zone_t</tt> nodes in this example
must have different names (recall the earlier discussion of
<a href="#Zonenaming">zone naming</a>).
However, if they are located in different places in the hierarchy, two
nodes with the same label can have the same name.  For example, 
both of the <tt>FlowSolution_t</tt> nodes, located in two different
zones, have been given the same user-defined
name:  "<tt>My Soln</tt>" in the example.

<p>
Finally, although the <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt> nodes were not included in this
example, note that if they were, they should describe the boundary
conditions on all boundary faces <em>except</em> the 
<i>k</i>-max face of zone 1 and the <i>k</i>-min face of zone 2.  These
two faces would not be included in the boundary conditions because they
are already defined as connectivity interfaces.
