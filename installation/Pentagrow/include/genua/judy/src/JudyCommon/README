# This tree contains sources for Judy common files.  These include shared
# header files, ifdef'd common source files for Judy1/JudyL functions, and
# shared utility functions.


# SHARED HEADER FILES:

JudyPrivate.h		global private header file for all Judy internal
			sources

JudyPrivateBranch.h	global private header file for all Judy internal
			sources, specifically for branch-related
			declarations

JudyPrivate1L.h		global private header file for Judy internal
			sources that generate both Judy1 and JudyL
			object files, via -DJUDY1 or -DJUDYL, using
			common names for JP Types, plus some other
			generic declarations too


# IFDEF'D COMMON SOURCE FILES FOR JUDY1/JUDYL FUNCTIONS:
#
# See Judy(3C) manual entry about these sources for exported functions.

JudyGet.c		common code for Judy1Test() and JudyLGet()
JudyIns.c		common code for Judy1Set() and JudyLIns()
JudyDel.c		common code for Judy1Unset() and JudyLDel()
JudyFirst.c		common code for Judy1 and JudyL
JudyPrevNext.c		common code for Judy1, JudyL; Judy*Prev(), Judy*Next()
JudyPrevNextEmpty.c	common code for Judy1, JudyL; Judy*PrevEmpty(),
			Judy*NextEmpty()
JudyCount.c		common code for Judy1 and JudyL
JudyByCount.c		common code for Judy1 and JudyL
JudyFreeArray.c		common code for Judy1 and JudyL
JudyMemUsed.c		common code for Judy1 and JudyL
JudyMemActive.c		common code for Judy1 and JudyL

# SHARED UTILITY FUNCTIONS:

JudyMalloc.c		source file

JudyTables.c		static definitions of translation tables; a main
			program is #ifdef-embedded to generate these tables

# Common code for Judy1 and JudyL that is compiled twice with -DJUDY1 or
# -DJUDYL:

JudyInsertBranch.c	insert a linear branch between a branch and a leaf
JudyCreateBranch.c	create and copy all types of branches

JudyCascade.c		handles overflow insertion of an Index, including
			common Decode bytes and branch creation

JudyDecascade.c		handles underflow deletion of an Index, including
			common Decode bytes and branch deletion

JudyMallocIF.c		a Judy malloc/free interface, for statistics and
			debugging

JudyPrintJP.c		debug/trace code #included in other *.c files
