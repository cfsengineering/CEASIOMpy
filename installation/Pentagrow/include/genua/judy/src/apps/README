# This tree contains sources for Judy-related applications, that is, for
# sources including a main() function, suitable for building an executable
# program.  Some of these sources are packaged and delivered to Judy users
# as an optional package of example sources.

benchmark/	sources for benchmarking programs, that is, demos that
		yield performance metrics; including sources for metrics
		displayed on the Judy website

demo/		sources for programs that demonstrate the use of Judy
		but are probably not useful as templates for writing
		Judy-based applications

# misc/		other sources; none exist at this time; and as they come
		along, they might go in misc/ or in other, more-specific
		directories

noship/		other example sources we are not free to deliver to Judy
		users, or which it's inappropriate or premature to deliver
