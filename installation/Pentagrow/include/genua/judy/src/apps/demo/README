# Demo programs to be included with the Judy distribution.

README_deliver	delivered with files from this directory, renamed to "README"

run_demo	simple Judy example script; explains, shows source code,
		compiles and runs it

Makefile_deliver
		delivered as "Makefile"; by default, makes all the demo
		programs; the libJudy.a and Judy.h locations might have
		to be changed (via cc -I options)
		NOTE:  This file contains "#ifdef" directives that look
		to make like comments, but don't expect the makefile to
		run prior to unifdef'ing in the makefile.  That is, use
		the constructed version for a given platform.

interL.c	interactive JudyL program
interSL.c	interactive JudySL program
