# CEASIOMpy - Test case 2

## Create and run a workflow with the GUI (Video tutorial)

In this second test case, you will see how to create a CEASIOMpy workflow with the help of the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
To run this test case, you will need to open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
# To be in the CEASIOMpy Conda environment with all the dependencies
conda activate ceasiompy

# To run the test case 2
ceasiompy_run --testcase 2
```

By running the above command, a new tab should appear in your default web browser, from there you can follow the steps which are done in the video:
