# CEASIOMpy - Test case 2

## Create and run a workflow with the GUI

In this second test case, you will learn how to create a CEASIOMpy workflow with the help of the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
To run this test case, you will need to open a terminal and run the following command (:warning: Working directory for this test case will be written where you are running the command):

```bash
# To be in the CEASIOMpy Conda environment with all the dependencies
conda activate ceasiompy

# To run the test case 2
ceasiompy_run --testcase 2
```

By running the above command, you will see the following window:

<p align="center">
<img height="600" src="testcase2_workflow_creator.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
CEASIOMpy Workflow Creator GUI
</p>

The different important parts of this window are:

1. Selection of the Working Directory (where your project will be saved)
1. Selection of the input CPACS file
1. List of all the available modules that could be used to create the workflow
1. Button to add/remove/move modules in your workflow
1. List of all the modules in your workflow (:warning: the order is important)

With this GUI, you will try to build the following workflow:

```mermaid
  graph LR;
      D150([D150 CPACS file])-->CPACSCreator;
      CPACSCreator-->CPACS2GMSH;
      CPACS2GMSH-->SU2Run;
      SU2Run-->PlotAeroCoefficients;
```

To do so, you will have to:

* Change the working directory, if needed.
* Keep the CPACS file as is.
* Add one by one, the modules to the workflow.

Your Selected modules list should now look like this:

<p align="center">
<img height="220" src="testcase2_selected_modules.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
</p>

We can now click on "Save & Quit" on the bottom of the window. The window will close and the `CPACSCreator` window will open.

CPACSCreator Interface
</p>

With CPACSCreator, you can modify the geometry of the aircraft. You will not do that in this tutorial, but you can check the following links for more information:

* [CPACSCreator tutorial](https://dlr-sc.github.io/tigl/doc/cpacscreator-0.1/tuto.html#tuto_create_from_scratch)

* [CPACSCreator video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ryc7HT3uA)

In this case, you can just save the file and close the window. The next step will run automatically. It will convert the geometry and create a mesh with `GMSH` and then run a CFD calculation with `SU2`. It could take a while depending on your computer. You should be able to see what is happening in the the terminal window or by reading the log file: */CEASIOMpy/ceasiompy.txt*

When the calculation is over, a new window will open with some graphs of the aerodynamic coefficients. On these graphs, you can see there is only one point, it correspond to the calculation which just has been performed. In the next test case you will see how to perform calculations on a larger aerodynamic database and plot the polars.
